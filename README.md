Automaton automates the process of executing benchmark applications on various
resources (e.g., infrastructure clouds and clusters). Ideally this will include all steps from provisioning cloud resources, downloading, configuring, and compiling the benchmark applications, executing the applications, gathering the results, and generating graphs.
